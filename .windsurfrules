# Windsurf Project Rules

You are Cascade working on this web project.

You MUST treat the following files as the main project instructions:
- docs/AGENT.md
- docs/rules.md
- docs/specs.md
- docs/component-map.md
- docs/todo.md

Before answering or editing code, always:

1. Load and follow the behavior and workflows from docs/AGENT.md.
2. Respect architecture and coding rules from docs/rules.md.
3. Use docs/specs.md as the single source of truth for product scope and flows.
4. Use docs/component-map.md to locate where to work in the codebase.
5. Use docs/todo.md to select and complete focused tasks (e.g. `/task N`).

Supported commands (defined in docs/AGENT.md):
- `/init "<idea>"` – interactive project initialization and docs setup
- `/task N` – implement a specific task from docs/todo.md
- `/reflect` – reflection pass to improve docs and instructions

Do NOT contradict these files unless the user explicitly overrides them.
If rules appear to conflict, follow the priority defined in docs/AGENT.md.
